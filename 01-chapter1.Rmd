## Introduction

<!-- Sample paragraph. -->

This is text for the introduction. You can cite literature by using the citation key found in the `.bib` file you provide using the notation `[@CitationKey]`. For example, including `[@Bernardo2010]` will lead to [@Bernardo2010]. See https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html for more information.


## Methods and Materials

<!-- Example paragraph with an equation that is numbered so it can be referenced within the text. -->

This is a paragraph with an equation, which follows:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:I1}
  \mathbf{y = 1\mu + Z_{TP} u + e},
\end{equation}

The equation is numbered. Isn't that something.


<!-- "\noindent" prevents indents when a new paragraph is made. -->

\noindent
This paragraph will not start with an indent.

<!-- Example paragraph with refernce to a figure and an equation. -->

This paragraph references a figure by using the notation `\ref{fig:fig12}`. It is rendered as \ref{fig:fig12}. You can add "Figure" or "Fig." beforehand to make it Fig. \ref{fig:fig12}. You can also reference an equation using the notation `Eq. \ref{eq:I1}`. It is rendered as Eq. \ref{eq:I1}.

## Figures

<!-- According to the formatting guidelines, figure captions can be single spaced. -->

\singlespace

<!-- Use "&nbsp;" to skip a line -->

&nbsp;

<!-- An example of including a figure. -->
<!-- {r fig11} means the figure is given the name "fig11," which can be referenced in the text. -->
<!-- fig.cap is the full-length caption -->
<!-- fig.scap is the short version of the caption. This will appear in the list of figures/tables. -->

```{r fig11, fig.cap="Figure caption", fig.scap="Short figure caption"}

## include_graphics allows knitr to output a figure that is not generated by R.
include_graphics(path = file.path(figure_dir, "Figure_1.jpg"), auto_pdf = TRUE)
```


\newpage


```{r fig12, fig.cap="Figure caption", fig.scap="Short figure caption"}

## include_graphics allows knitr to output a figure that is not generated by R.
include_graphics(path = file.path(figure_dir, "Figure_2.jpg"), auto_pdf = TRUE)
```





## Tables

&nbsp;



<!-- An example of including a figure. -->
<!-- {r tab31} means the figure is given the name "tab31," which can be referenced in the text. -->
<!-- Table captions (long and short) are arguments in kable -->

```{r tab11}

## Read in table
# tab <- read_csv(file = file.path(table_dir, "Table1.csv"))


# Alternatively, use the mtcars table
tab <- mtcars

## Print table
## align is a character vector of alignment designations. "l" for left, "c" for center, "r" for right.
## booktabs creates a little overhang on the top and bottom lines of the table.
## caption is the long caption
## escape is used if you have special characters, like "*" that need to be escaped (using "//")
## caption.short is the short caption.
kable(x = tab, align = paste0(c("l", rep("c", ncol(tab) - 1))), booktabs = T, longtable = TRUE,
      caption = "Table caption.", escape = FALSE, caption.short = "Short table caption.") %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 10) %>%
  ## These adjust the width of some columns
  column_spec(1, width = "8em") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "11em") %>%
  column_spec(5, width = "9em") 
  
```








## Supplemental Figures



&nbsp;


<!-- An example of including a supplemental figure -->
<!-- The rules are the same as for regular figures. -->

```{r fig11S, fig.cap="Figure caption", fig.scap="Short figure caption"}

## include_graphics allows knitr to output a figure that is not generated by R.
include_graphics(path = file.path(figure_dir, "Figure_S1.jpg"), auto_pdf = TRUE)
```




## Supplemental Tables

  ## These adjust the width of some columns
  column_spec(1, width = "8em") %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "11em") %>%
